 * @fileoverview Server action for adding a line item to the shopping cart.

 *   mutation by delegating validation, mutation execution and error handling
 *   to specialized helpers.  Keeping the action focused on a single
 *   responsibility helps maintain clear boundaries between validation,
 *   business logic and error formatting, and makes the code easier for AI
 *   assistants and other tooling to reason about.
